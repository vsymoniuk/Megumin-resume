                      Wahahahahaha! My name is Megumin, the number one mage of
                      Axel and one of the main characters of the KonoSuba
                      series. After travelling to Axel Town, I had quickly
                      gained a reputation as a crazy Explosion fanatic, thus
                      parties refused to accept me before I met Kazuma and Aqua.

                      I decided to become an Explosion mage after a busty older
                      woman saved me with Explosion magic when I was young, and
                      after this accident, I must cast Explosion once a day or
                      die.

                      I adore cute, or cool looking monsters, and don`t want to
                      attack them, there is only thing that can change my mind
                      is an fact that for this monster is given a lot of
                      experience, or a spectacular title.

                      While still attending school, Megumin would swindle food
                      from Yunyun every day since her parents couldn't afford
                      meals. Due to her exceptional academic performance,
                      Megumin was able to graduate early. When she left to
                      travel alone, Yunyun predicted she would be "at a loss due
                      to a lack in the means of survival, begging a useless guy
                      for a meal."

                      For a few weeks, I was practising my explosion magic on a
                      seemingly abandoned castle. This had ended up infuriating
                      the general, Verdia the Dullahan, who had been living in
                      that very castle

                      Still using Dullahan`s castle for explosion practice. With
                      the support of the team, we killed the Demon King general
                      - Verdia the Dullahan.

                    I am little bit oBsEsSeD with explosive magic and wasting
                    all my points on increasing damage and reducing the time to
                    prepare spells. And since all points go to the attack, I do
                    not have a “penny” to replenish the mana supply, because of
                    which, after each cast, I cannot even move a finger. There is a proof of my <b> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMnU3Ejuxm4">InFiNiTy ExPlOsIoN pOwEr</a></b>
